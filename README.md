# ðŸŽ¤ Week08 Bootcamp2018c Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

youll see some code that has been commented out that was my original approach to this project i wanted to be able to have the questions asked then based upon the answers you would get a specific name, i hit a wall and then tried a different approaxh that i felt worked for the time being while i worked on getting the original plan working,

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

i would hvae simplified the codes given more time

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the importance of psudo code and how it will help you iron out your code

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
